## Discord Connections

This repository is a python client for creating custom Discord Сonnections. It is based on [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/configuring-app-metadata-for-linked-roles) and [example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/linked-role-discord-bot) provided by Discord team. Connections allow you to connect any game or web resource with Discord account and see in-game (or web resource) nickname and statistics inside Discord in user profile, e.g. there are X, YT, Twitch, Reddit connections (User Settings > Connections). [Detailed description](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members).

With this repository you can create your own Connection!
