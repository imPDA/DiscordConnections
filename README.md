## Discord Connections

### What the Connections are:
 - Discord connections refer to the integrations and connections between a 
Discord account and other services, platforms, or applications. These connections 
can include linking social media accounts, streaming platforms, gaming consoles,
and other third-party services to a Discord account. By connecting these services, 
users can easily share their activities, status updates, or content across different 
platforms and engage with others in various ways. Some common Discord connections 
include linking Twitch, YouTube, Spotify, Twitter, Xbox, and PlayStation accounts 
to Discord for enhanced functionality and interaction (see User Settings > Connections).
